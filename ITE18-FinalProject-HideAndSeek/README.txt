ITE18 -  PROJECT 
FIND THE MISSING PERSON MINI GAME

Look for # of PERSON

==========================================================
On your journey you came across a lone house beside the street with the owner named MIKE seeking help
to locate # of person inside the forest before the sun completely sets(cant do that)

MIKE looks visible anxious (model cant look like that) and seemed to really care about the missing person so 
you agreed to look for them.

Each person you find is also visibly anxious and very scared than you thought they would be.

After you found each person you come back to the house and speak with MIKE. It turns out MIKE is a serial killer
and the people you found are his escaped victims so he adds you to his collections.

END
